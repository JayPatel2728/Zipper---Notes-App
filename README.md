# Zipper-Notes-App

This is my first fullstack application, I have also used redux for state managenment and bootstrap for UI. Full user authentication was completed using JWT and bcrypt to encrypt the passwords. Some challenges along the way was to figure out how to manage all the state in a big application also this was my first deployment to Heroku which was new.
